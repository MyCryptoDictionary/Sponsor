Intro To MyCryptoDictionary App Project

MyCryptoDictionary is born out of my desire and passion to help newbies learn and understand the new innovative language that cryptocurrency and its disruptive underlying blockchain technology have created. It is glaring that mass adoption is coming; and to help the influx of newbies, they need access to a platform they contain crypto lingos/jargons and guide with there meaning in a non-tech form, easier to understand and assimilate. That is simply what MyCryptoDictionary is set out to achieve. 

It now has over 650 crypto terms and meaning accessible 100% FREE via http://MyCryptoDictionary.com Web/App and new terms researched and added daily till when 5,000 crypto terms/meaning targets will be achieved.

Aside from the crypto terms and meaning, the app also contains News section which aggregates news from top crypto news websites/blogs worldwide to make it easier for a newbie to keep a tab on latest happening in their obviously new world (Cryptosphere) in one app via http://MyCryptoDictionary.com/Blog.

Added to it is a simplified documentation section which is to create tutorials on different crypto projects and how newbies can use their platforms even if it is their first time without difficulty. Thus, it is well structured and outlined step-by-step with text, screenshots and short segmented videos. Also free via http://MyCryptoDictionary.com/doc.
