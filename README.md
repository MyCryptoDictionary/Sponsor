Intro To MyCryptoDictionary App Project

MyCryptoDictionary is born out of my desire and passion to help newbies learn and understand the new innovative language that cryptocurrency and its disruptive underlying blockchain technology have created. It is glaring that mass adoption is coming; and to help the influx of newbies, they need access to a platform with crypto lingos/jargons and guide with there meaning in a non-tech form, easier to understand and assimilate. That is simply what MyCryptoDictionary is set out to achieve. 

It now has over 650 crypto terms and meaning accessible 100% FREE via http://MyCryptoDictionary.com Web/App and new terms researched and added daily till when 5,000 crypto terms/meaning targets will be achieved.

Aside from the crypto terms and meaning, the app also contains News section which aggregates news from top crypto news websites/blogs worldwide to make it easier for a newbie to keep a tab on latest happening in their obviously new world (Cryptosphere) in one app via http://MyCryptoDictionary.com/Blog.

Added to it is a simplified documentation section which is to create tutorials on different crypto projects and how newbies can use their platforms even if it is their first time without difficulty. Thus, it is well structured and outlined step-by-step with text, screenshots and short segmented videos. Also free via http://MyCryptoDictionary.com/doc.

Why Raise Fund For The Project?
-
I believe one of the benefit crypto has brought is removing middleman and making the world accessible in a click in a trustless decentralized environment. Thus, have decided to put this to test and possibly been able to prove it to the world if this first of its kind fundraising succeeds. That cryptocurrency gives avenue not just to financial, health and other sectors but also facilitate getting fund for startups with visible and viable product/service (online or offline) anywhere in the world.

I have the following to be achieved if this fundraising succeeds for the next phase of the project;

The project started December 10th, 2017 (7months ago) and have singlehandedly run the development from domain to web/app design/development, crypto terms research and updating, dedicating about 5-16hours daily for the past 7 months to make make it a reality of what it is today. Thus, at this stage need to bring in more skilled hands and also build a large community around it to acheive it purpose.

Have been able to have an estimate of $50,000 required for the following;

1) $10,000 = Upgrade of the Web App from shared host to dedicated hosting with SSL and others to continously meetup server useage and security demand by the influx of news users in this next phase.

2) $5,000 = iOS App and upgrade version of the current Android App

3) $15,000 = for the team and this helps to hire atleast 5 new team members to fast track the delivery of 5,000 crypto terms/meaning

4) $20,000 = with target to reach 100,000 - 250,000 user community via advertisement using majorly crypto ads platforms and sponsored reviews on popular crypto news/review websites/blog.

How Does The Project Gives Back To Sponsor & Cryptocommunity As A Whole?

1) This project has been TOKENIZED on WAVES Blockchain with aim to financially impact a lot of lifes of user and encourage more newbies to adopt crypto by giving 99% of the tokens free via Airdrop and other user driven activities.

2) We will also offer token buyback from the open market (exchange) with upto 50% of advertisement income monthly till about 50% of total token supply (76Billion) burnt. Advertisers will also need to purchase the token from the open exchange for ads in the App in future.
